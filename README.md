# Luhn-Algorithm
Implementing Luhn Algorithm to different platforms. 

More infomation can be found [in Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Luhn_algorithm)

You can checkout the code for SQL implementation [here](https://github.com/mbista/Luhn-Algorithm/blob/master/TestForMod10ForNPI.sql).

This can be set as a SQL function if you wanted to do a quick check, however, you can just use a stored procedure for the code to be implemented.
